										Back in January, I started relearning HTML. We started off with the absolute basics for a webpage: just text. We were asked to 
										make a personal webpage that contained content about ourselves or whatever we'd like to include. I chose to make my page a mix of 
										a personal blog/bio and professional website. My original Home Page is made up only of HTML paragraphs and headings and includes information 
										about my skills such as C++ and Python experience and my interests, mostly playing my guitar.
										<br>
										<br>
										On that original page, I didn't really know what all to include. I felt like I was throwing things at the wall to see what stuck. 
										In the next assignment, I was tasked with adding a table, a form, links, images, videos, and lists to the home page. To do so in a 
										way that <i>mostly</i> made sense, I had to add more information to the page(s). In the second edition of the page, I listed more of my skills and more about 
										my guitars. The unordered list proved to be a good way to organize that information. I found that these assignments not only taught us the basics, but also 
										gave me insight on when I should use which element to best organize and present information. After nearly every assignment, this page was updated with links to 
										new pages. I've chosen to link the most recent version so you may visit all of those if you choose.

										After that lab assignment, we were asked to implement the same elements into a website for a fictional Brazilian restaurant. 
										The website includes multiple images, a form for reservations, and a separate page for the menus to be listed. It was still simple 
										and had no styles applied, but I felt quite proud of this page. For this page, I made several images in MS Visio and Paint to serve as 
										a button in lieu of a real one. I really enjoyed learning about the Brazilian cuisine even though it made me quite hungry to do so. That page can be found 
										clicking the button below.

										While the midterm project was not based on anything new, it proved to be a formidable task. I was asked to create a website for a travel 
										agency: MAXimum WELLness Travel. I preferred to call it MAXWELL Travel or MWT; for some reason the half-capitalization bothered me. The MWT website 
										was to have 3 pages.

										Following the Midterm, we began to venture into new territory. Although I earned a certification for HTML5 and CSS years ago, 
										my experience with both was minimal. I received that certification through memorization alone, so I was excited to actually learn CSS. 
										For this module, I was tasked with adding styles to the home page for myself. The style I ended up adopting is fairly simple, I believe, but it is 
										much more enjoyable to read than the unstyled version. You may see the interactive version of the page by clicking the button below.
										<br>
										<br>
										The final focus of the class was put on interactivity. We learned about multiple different ways to do so: CSS, Javascript/JQuery, and Bootstrap. 
										CSS and JS/JQuery were very confusing to me. It was difficult to create what I wanted and it was difficult to distinguish between JQuery and JS. 
										All of the interactivity I created with that can be seen on the indexGrid2Activity page above.
										I found Bootstrap to be much easier to use, but that comes at a cost if you are lazy.
									</p>

										This page uses Bootstrap heavily to implement most of its interactivity because I found it to be the easiest and most polished. However, I also 
										found that the way I/we used Bootstrap led to the pages looking and feeling generic. The reason for this is because I didn't write any of the styles 
										myself; I had been using templates and tweaking them to get the desired results. For example, the purple Bootstrap badge on this section's heading uses 
										a custom style to set the background color and text color, mimicking the other preset badges from Bootstrap. I think this is the simplest example of 
										Bootstrap's ideal use case: a library of options for developers to expand upon to customize their creations. Contrast this to the Bootstrap assignment 
										where I did not do so much if at all. Using Bootstrap, we were asked to redesign the Brazilian restaurant page. The result is linked below.
