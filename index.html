										Back in January, I started relearning HTML. We started off with the absolute basics for a webpage: just text. We were asked to 
										make a personal webpage that contained content about ourselves or whatever we'd like to include. I chose to make my page a mix of 
										a personal blog/bio and professional website. My original Home Page is made up only of HTML paragraphs and headings and includes information 
										about my skills such as C++ and Python experience and my interests, mostly playing my guitar.
										<br>
										<br>
										On that original page, I didn't really know what all to include. I felt like I was throwing things at the wall to see what stuck. 
										In the next assignment, I was tasked with adding a table, a form, links, images, videos, and lists to the home page. To do so in a 
										way that <i>mostly</i> made sense, I had to add more information to the page(s). In the second edition of the page, I listed more of my skills and more about 
										my guitars. The unordered list proved to be a good way to organize that information. I found that these assignments not only taught us the basics, but also 
										gave me insight on when I should use which element to best organize and present information. I've chosen to link the second edition but not the first.

										After that lab assignment, we were asked to implement the same elements into a website for a fictional Brazilian restaurant. 
										The website includes multiple images, a form for reservations, and a separate page for the menus to be listed. It was still simple 
										and had no styles applied, but I felt quite proud of this page. For this page, I made several images in MS Visio and Paint to serve as 
										a button in lieu of a real one. I really enjoyed learning about the Brazilian cuisine even though it made me quite hungry to do so. That page can be found 
										clicking the button below.

										While the midterm project was not based on anything new, it proved to be a formidable task. I was asked to create a website for a travel 
										agency: MAXimum WELLness Travel. I prefered to call it MAXWELL Travel or MWT; for some reason the half-capitalization urked me. The MWT website 
										was to have 3 pages.

										Following the Midterm, we began to venture into new territory. Although I earned a certification for HTML5 and CSS years ago, 
										my experience with both was minimal. I received that certification through memorization alone, so I was excited to actually learn CSS. 
										For this module, I was tasked with adding styles to the home page for myself. The style I ended up adopting is fairly simple, I believe, but it is 
										much more enjoyable to read than the unstyled version. You may see the interactive version of the page by clicking the button below.
