            <p>
                Hayden Coble is a CS student at Athens State University expecting to graduate Fall 2024. He is also a tutor in the MCNS Learning Lab on campus. 
                He came back and edited this file several times because he felt as though he had not typed enough. In the end, he hopes more than anything
                 he wrote enough text here to be considered a paragraph. He doesn't know what else to type in this section, but he certainly hopes
                you enjoyed reading it.

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>
                During his time in school and on the internet in his own time,
                Hayden has learned a number of things about programming. His first program was written in JavaScript in a high school programming class offered at the Limestone County Career
                and Technical Center. In that class, he learned to build a website in HTML and even received a certification in HTML5 and CSS (although he is very rusty on it). 
                He also made a videogame in that class: Solar Defense - Pilots From Pluto. The game was influenced by Galaga and Asteroids, and was made in Game Maker Studio.
                He made this game with a partner from the class; he wrote most of the code and music while his partner made the art for the game. At the state level, the game won
                first place in Video Game Design at the SkillsUSA Alabama conference.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, Hayden is most experienced with C++ programming but has recently started to strengthen his SQL and Python for a personal
                project of his own. He has also had a bit of experience with many other languages for assignments
                here and there, some older than his parents. Most recently, he's taking CS307 to relearn HTML and Web Development!

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>
                Hayden is very interested in technology and music, and of course, music technology.</p>
            <p>
                He enjoys playing his guitar and pretending he can buy more. His prized posession is his Epiphone Les Paul Traditional Pro in Wine Red, and his "white whale" he's looking for is a limited run
                Fender Telecaster made in Japan. He also enjoys working on his guitars as much as playing them.
                His Stratocaster has Seymour Duncan pickups to suit his sonic preferences, and his Thunderbird bass has aftermarket Hipshot brand tuning machines. He's recently started the project of building 
                another guitar custom to him with his partner Elizabeth. He will pick the parts that he prefers, and she will design the finish of the guitar. He's eager to have a new favorite. major musical
                influences include Incubus, Foo Fighters, Daft Punk, deadmau5, and Gary Clark Jr. His music preference
                is primarily rock music, but if he listens hard enough, he'll find a reason to like most genres.
                From bluegrass to metal to hip-hop to house music, it's all in his playlist.
            </p>

                On the tech side of things, he's currently trying to find a good project to put his Raspberry Pi to use. There are so many options, he is overwhelmed with possibilities.
                He likes learning how different electronics work and seeing people build new things out of old ones.
                He hopes one day to join them as a maker; why buy things when you can do it all yourself? When he can, he wants to pickup woodworking as a hobby. Maybe then he can make that guitar completely his own!
