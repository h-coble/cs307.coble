						During his time in school and on the internet in his own time,
						Hayden has learned a number of things about programming. His first program was written in JavaScript in a high school programming class offered at the Limestone County Career
						and Technical Center. In that class, he learned to build a website in HTML and even received a certification in HTML5 and CSS (although he is very rusty on it). 
						He also made a videogame in that class: Solar Defense - Pilots From Pluto. The game was influenced by Galaga and Asteroids, and was made in Game Maker Studio.
						He made this game with a partner from the class; he wrote most of the code and music while his partner made the art for the game. At the state level, the game won
						first place in Video Game Design at the SkillsUSA Alabama conference.
					</p>

					<p>
						Now, Hayden is most experienced with C++ programming but has recently started to strengthen his SQL and Python for a personalproject of his own. He has also had a bit of experience with many other languages for assignments
									here and there, some older than his parents. Most recently, he's taking CS307 to relearn HTML and Web Development!
