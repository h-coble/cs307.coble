                    <p>
                        Hayden enjoys playing his guitar and pretending he can buy more. His prized posession is his Epiphone Les Paul Traditional Pro in Wine Red, and his "white whale" he's looking for is a limited run
                        Fender Telecaster made in Japan. He also enjoys working on his guitars as much as playing them.
                        His Stratocaster has Seymour Duncan pickups to suit his sonic preferences, and his Thunderbird bass has aftermarket Hipshot brand tuning machines. He's recently started the project of building 
                        another guitar custom to him with his partner Elizabeth. He will pick the parts that he prefers, and she will design the finish of the guitar. He's eager to have a new favorite. major musical
                        influences include Incubus, Foo Fighters, Daft Punk, deadmau5, and Gary Clark Jr. His music preference
                        is primarily rock music, but if he listens hard enough, he'll find a reason to like most genres.
                        From bluegrass to metal to hip-hop to house music, it's all in his playlist.

                    <p>
                        On the tech side of things, he's currently trying to find a good project to put his Raspberry Pi to use. There are so many options, he is overwhelmed with possibilities.
                        He likes learning how different electronics work and seeing people build new things out of old ones.
                        He hopes one day to join them as a maker; why buy things when you can do it all yourself? When he can, he wants to pickup woodworking as a hobby. Maybe then he can make that guitar completely his own!
