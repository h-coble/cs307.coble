                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify the online color converter you used to complete this assignment. Include an absolute link to your resource and include the target attribute to open the page in a new tab. -->
                <p>Color Converter Used: <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hsl.asp" target = "_blank">W3 Schools HSL</a></p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to compare and contrast your findings regarding hexadecimal, RGB, and HSL color codes. -->
                <p>RGB values are numbers to represent how much red, blue, and green are mixed to result in the color specified on a scale from 
                    1 - 255. Hex values do the same, but in hexadecimal from 00 - FF for each color. HSL is designed for human readability. The values represent 
                    Hue, Saturation, and Lightness. Hue is a degree measurement on the color wheel, and the other two are percentages. Saturation is the % of how 
                    "colorful" the color is: lower percentages are more gray and higher percentages are more vibrant. Lightness is straightforward: how bright is the color?
                </p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify your preferred color code format (hexadecimal, RBG, or HSL) and why. -->
                <p>Preferred color code format: I personally prefer Hex because I have had the most experience with it. I find it easier to use than HSL because it's just color mixing 
                    instead of having to worry about "shading" as I would describe it. I find the hex values easier to think about and write than rgb values due to fewer keystrokes.

                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss HWB color. -->
                <p>HWB summary:<br>
                    HWB stands for Hue, whiteness, and blackness and was created with the idea that a user can specify a hue then mix black and white into it to get the desired color. 
                    Black and white values are percentages, and hue is a degree measurement of the color wheel.

                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss CMYK color. -->
                <p>CMYK summary:<br>
                    CMYK stands for cyan magenta yellow and key (black). It's a subtractive color model; it's intended to be used with a light/white background and the colors subtract color from the white, 
                    resulting in a desired shade. This contrasts from the RGB model which is additive. In RGB, full values added together results in white and 0 is black. In the CMYK model, the inverse is true.
