                Hayden Coble is a CS student at Athens State University expecting to graduate Fall 2024.
                He doesn't know what else to type in this section, but he certainly hopes
                you enjoyed reading it.
            </p>

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>
                During his time in school and on the internet in his own time,
                Hayden has learned a number of things about programming. He is most experienced
                with C++ programming but has recently started to strengthen his SQL and Python for a personal
                project of his own. He has also had a bit of experience with many other languages for assignments
                here and there. Most recently, he's taking CS307 to relearn HTML and Web Development!
            </p>

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>
                Hayden is very interested in technology and music, and of course, music technology.</p>
            <p>
                He enjoys playing his guitar and pretending he can buy more. his major musical
                influences include Incubus, Foo Fighters, Daft Punk, deadmau5, and Gary Clark Jr. His music preference
                is primarily rock music, but if he listens hard enough, he'll find a reason to like most genres.
                From bluegrass to metal to hip-hop to house music, it's all in his playlist.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the tech side of things, he's currently trying to find a good project to put his Raspberry Pi to use.
                He likes learning how different electronics work and seeing people build new things out of old ones.
                He hopes one day to join them as a maker; why buy things when you can do it all yourself?
            </p>

            <h2>Contact</h2>
            <p>
                Hayden can be contacted by phone or discord, but he doesn't like to share that information
                with everyone. It is best that you contact him via e-mail and earn his trust first. <br>
